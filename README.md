The code in this notebook details work from my Physics Special Studies Program project to model the terrestrial ionosophere - an environment which significantly affects modern satellite communicaton systems. The electron density is the key component of interest of the ionosphere and there are two primary sections of the work:
The first section extracts ionosophere data taken from the European Space Agency's SPENVIS portal and graphs the zenith electron density profile over four anti-podal locations around the globe as a simple demonstration of the commonalities and differences of the ionospheric electron density profile around Earth.
The second section of the notebook details work to optimise the hydrogen 2s orbital's electron probability function to fit real ionosphere electron density data. This was motivated by the resemblence of the 2s orbital electron probability function with the idealized ionosophere zenith electron density profile. The non-linear least squares and Nelder-Mead methods were used and the quality of the fits assessed by residuals plots.
